# Setup an Developement Environment

In order to setup a developement environment you need to intsall *Node.js*,
a code editor like *Visual Studio Code* and the version control system *Git*.
Please make sure to install the latest version of both *Node.js* and *Git* on 
your system.

If you are not sure in which order you should install the software mentioned 
above, you can follow this step-by-step guide:

We will start, by installing the version control system *Git*.
In order to install the version control system *Git*, please refer to the installation
instructions for your operating system found on the offical [website](https://git-scm.com/).
After downloading the latest installer, please follow the instructions of the wizard. Using the default settings is recommended for inexperienced users.
If you are new to *Git*, feel free to take a look at the offical beginners
[handbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

After installing *Git*, we will continue the setup process by downloading *Node.js*
from the official [website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Detailed installation instructions 
can be found in the documentation section there. For managing the projects dependencies the package manager *npm* is used. There are some other package managers as well, like *yarn*, so you need to choose the installer, that installs *npm* alongside *Node.js*. After downloading the installer, please follow the instructions of the wizard.

Lastly, you need to install a code editor of your choice. If you are new to software developement, feel free to use Microsoft's *Visual Studion Code*, as it is a versatlie, free and open-source code editor. You can download the latest version from the official [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). After downloading the installer, please follow the instructions of the wizard. Using the default settings is recommended for inexperienced users.

If you decided to use *Visual Studio Code*, you can install some extensions, to enhance your developement experience. Some recommended extensions are:
                
|Extension|Description|

|*mikestead.dotenv*|This extension adds syntax highlighting for *.env* files.|
|*dbaeumer.vscode-eslint*|This extension adds linting support for JavaScript files.|
